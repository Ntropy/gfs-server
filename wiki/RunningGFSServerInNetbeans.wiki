= Introduction =

To make it easy I simply archived the entire Netbeans 6.8 project for the GFS Server source code and files.


= Details =

*1.* Netbeans 6.8 was used for this project so it is in that particular format but can be easily moved to something else.

*2.* I put the dependent jar files in C:\jars.  You will need to modify that accordingly.  The dependent jar files should be in the "dist\lib" directory in the source download.

*3.* This was compiled and built with Java 1.6 and a slightly modified version of Mina 1.1.7.  See this blog entry for more details: http://giantflyingsaucer.com/blog/?p=7
